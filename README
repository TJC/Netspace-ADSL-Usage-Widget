This was an ADSL usage monitoring widget for Windows Vista/7,
for Netspace's ADSL services.

It is based upon work done by a previous author who had abandoned the project
by the time I created this one. (I have removed their name by request)
However now I, in turn, have abandoned this project, and am unable to offer
further support, bugfixes or improvements.

Compared to the previous version, my version has all the code inline, with no
scary remote-execution stuff going on.

It also fixes the bug that caused the old version to always require you to
re-enter the settings every time it loaded.

To use, download all the files and add them to a ZIP file, then rename it to
NetspaceWidget.gadget
Or just download the prepackaged version from
