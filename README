Hi,
This is a ADSL usage monitoring widget, for Netspace's ADSL services.

It is based upon work done by one Clayton Tuffin; however it seems they
abandoned the project, and it had a bad bug and somewhat worrying behaviour.
(It would retrieve and execute code from his server every time it ran..)

This version has all the code inline, with no remote-execution stuff at all.

It also fixes the bug that caused the old version to always require you to
re-enter the settings every time it loaded.

To use, download all the files and add them to a ZIP file, then rename it to
NetspaceWidget.gadget
Or just download the prepackaged version from
http://dryft.net/netspace/netspace_usage_widget.gadget
